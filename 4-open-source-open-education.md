# [open source !== open education](https://janke-learning.github.io/fosdem-2019/#/open-source-open-education)


[open education resources](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education) are resource used for education that are published under an open-source license.  This includes software but also things like slides, lesson plans, word problems, videos, etc. Let's that idea one step further and define __open education__ as:

> any educational content or methods that can be readily adopted & adapted to a wide variety of contexts by direct stakeholders (teachers, students, parents, employers, ...) working within their existing means.

provide two definitions, one for _open-source_ and one for _open-education_:
* __open-source__: any software for which the source code is freely available.  there are many different classes of open-source licenses, but they all share this common core.
* __open-education__: any form of education that can be readily adopted & adapted to wide variety of contexts by those directly involved (teachers, students, parents, employers, ...).

This definition of open-eductaion has stricter implications than does the more general definition of __open educational resources__.

  open source but not open education
    - freecodecamp
    source is available, but adapting it is beyond the skill or time of almost all educators or students
  open education but not open source
    - replit
    source is closed
    but the tool enables teachers to create and manage their own courses & exercises
    and students can use this to collaborate, share and study their own challenges
  open source & open education
    - python tutor
    the source is open for developers to do what we please with
    the tool is phenominal for enabling students and teachers to improve whatever they are doing

## [js-parsons](http://js-parsons.github.io/) vs. [parsonizer](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsonizer/)

[Parsons problems](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/sigcse2017/Directives/mixedUp.html) are a simple exercise that are very effective for helping beginner programmers learn the structures and logic of code without being overwhelmed by syntax, errors, and bugs.  Students are presented with the lines of a small script shuffled around, their task is to click and drag them into the right order.

__Js-parsons__ is an open source tool developed so teachers can embed parsons problems into their courses, [like so](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsons-control-flow/).  This is an outstanding open source educational tool, but it falls slightly short of being a full open-education tool because it is beyond a beginner student's ability to build or adapt their own parsons problems.  While this tool is simple enough to use, it is still complex enough that it would require quite some time and expertise for an average teacher to fully incorporate it into their existing course.

__Parsonizer__ is an open-education tool built around js-parsons that automatically generates a parsons problem for any given snippet of code.  The barriers to any student or teacher incorporating this tool into their existing course, or building a new course around it, are essentially none.  This is both open source and open education.
