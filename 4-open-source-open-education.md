# [open source !== open education](https://janke-learning.github.io/fosdem-2019/#/open-source-open-education)


In the world of computers and programming, there is open source.  In the world of education there are [open education resources](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education), resource used for education that are published under an open-source license.  This includes software but also things like slides, lesson plans, word problems, videos, etc. Let's that idea one step further and define __open education__ as:

> any educational content or method that can be readily adapted to a wide variety of learning environments by direct stakeholders (teachers, students, parents, employers, ...) working within their existing means.

This definition of open-eductaion is a stricter standard than is generally placed on open-source software or open educational resources, but it is a very important distinction to make. In the world of programming, every new piece of software and every additional tool can add substantial complexity to your project.  In the world of education resources are always short, professional trainings are too few, and workloads are too high.  On the flip side, teachers & students are the ones who know their contextual challenges better than anyone. 

When preparing open resources for computing education it is important to ballance ease of use with prescription, creating resources that enable teachers & students alike to flexibly update their existing courses or easily create new ones without needing to learn a whole new set of single-purpose tools.

## [js-parsons](http://js-parsons.github.io/) vs. [parsonizer](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsonizer/)

[Parsons problems](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/sigcse2017/Directives/mixedUp.html) are a simple exercise that are very effective for helping beginner programmers learn the structures and logic of code without being overwhelmed by syntax, errors, and bugs.  Students are presented with the lines of a small script shuffled around, their task is to click and drag them into the right order.

__Js-parsons__ is an open source tool developed so teachers can embed parsons problems into their courses, [like so](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsons-control-flow/).  This is an outstanding open source educational tool, but it falls slightly short of being a full open-education tool because it is beyond a beginner student's ability to build or adapt their own parsons problems.  While this tool is simple enough to use, it is still complex enough that it would require quite some time and expertise for an average teacher to fully incorporate it into their existing course.

__Parsonizer__ is an open-education tool built around js-parsons that automatically generates a parsons problem for any given snippet of code.  The barriers to any student or teacher incorporating this tool into their existing course, or building a new course around it, are essentially none.  This is both open source and open education.
