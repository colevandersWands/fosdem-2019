how about something that teaches programming and basic computational literacy at a true novice level, using the best known methods of instructional design, fully embedded in an opensource environment allowing students to not only learn programming but to immerse themselves in the open source method from day 1.  

  my proposed next level
    - janke learning
    a course that is open source, open education, and a friendly introduction to the world of open source development




pseudo-define computational literacy with the example projects


next level shit
  open source, open education embedded resources that students are prepared to contribute to shorty after studying them
  - arithmetic coercion
    the table is something incredibly helpful that can be easily replicted for any expression
  - trace and log
    the entire thing is nothing but a markdown.  teachers can easily curate the exercises for their needs, include additional resources, or integrate it into other resources
    students also can turn around and pr some inputs they found helpful, or recommend better wording, ...
  - boolean by example
    the content is structured just as a basic website. if a student were to recommend any changes, they have in fact practiced exactly contributing to a website

"minimal"?
