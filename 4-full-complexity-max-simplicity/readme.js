console.log(`
a series of examples to run/study/modify that focus on 'this' with dom elements and events

each example begins by demonstrating the target mechanism first with simple javascript objects
then demonstrates how the identical js mechnism works with dom elements

to study an example 
* open the sources tab in your dev tools
* select the file you want to study
* enter "load('name-of-file.js')" in the console
* study away!

for more in-depth study you can copy the scripts into devtool snippets
  this will allow you to test out changes and save your notes between visits
