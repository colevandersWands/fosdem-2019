demonstrating how the same coding challenge in different learning environments gives a very different experience and learning outcomes.

each example has the exact same challenge, test cases, explanation and resources, but they are not completely interchangeable:
* how does each environment change your interaction with the code, is one easier or harder?
* what implicit & explicit skills are practiced or avoided in each environment?
* which version will most directly prepare students for developing real projects in a professional development environment?
* which format is easier for making more exercises?  does amount the of effort relate to better student learning?

## For markdown & console

> Reverse the provided string.  
> You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.  
> Your result must be a string.  

* first, fork this repository onto your account
* to complete the exercise, copy the block below into the console
* when you think you've got it, hit enter to see how you did!
* you can rework your last try by hitting the up arrow
* to reset, simply delete the body of the function and start over
* to save your work, edit this markdown page and paste your solution from the console into this md

```js
{ 
  function reverseString(str) {
    return str;
  }

  var olleh_type = reverseString("hello");
  console.assert(typeof olleh_type === 'string', 
      'reverseString("hello") should return a string');

  var olleh_value = reverseString("hello");
  console.assert(olleh_value === 'olleh',  
      'reverseString("hello") should become "olleh".');

  var ydwoH = reverseString("Howdy");
  console.assert(ydwoH === 'ydwoH', 
      'reverseString("Howdy") should become "ydwoH".');

  var htraE_morf_sgniteerG = reverseString('Greetings from Earth');
  console.assert(htraE_morf_sgniteerG === 'htraE morf sgniteerG', 
      'reverseString("Greetings from Earth") should become "htraE morf sgniteerG".');

};
