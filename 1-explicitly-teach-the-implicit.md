# explicitly teach the implicit

one of the most crucial skills that experienced developers have, but usually isn't taught explicitly, is the ability to trace through code in their head one operation at a time.  without this skill new programmers are left having to fix bugs with trial and error, write new code by pasting together other snippets & hoping for the best, and settling for rough behavior-level understadings of new code they encounter.

all of this can be easily avoided if you explicitly teach how to look inside a dense block of code and see it for what it is, nothing but a well-defined series of simple operations.
